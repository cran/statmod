18 February 2010: statmod 1.4.3

- add new function permp() which correctly calculates permutation 
  probabilities.

5 January 2010: statmod 1.4.2

- add new argument 'dispersion' to glm.scoretest()
- ensure chisq values from limdil() remain positive, even when small.
- correct the format of chisq value in print.limdil().

29 Sep 2009: statmod 1.4.1

- fixes to documentation links to other packages
- bug fix to glmgam.fit() when there are exact zeros
  in the data or fitted values.
- add more goodness of fit tests to elda().
- improvements to print.limdil method.
- argument log added to dinvgauss(), giving the option of
  returning the density on the log-scale.

6 May 2009: statmod 1.4.0

- new function glm.scoretest() to compute likelihood score tests
  for terms in generalized linear models.
- Improvements to elda() and print.limdil() to avoid glm fits in
  extreme data situations with 0% or 100% positive response,
  improving speed and avoiding warnings.
- Improvements to print.limdil method.
- New function .limdil.allpos(). It calculates lower bound of
  the limdil confidence interval when all tests respond by using
  a globally convergent Newton interation.
- Modify limdil() on lower bound of the confidence interval when all 
  tests respond. 
- New methods print.limdil and plot.limdil for limdil objects.
- The output from limdil() is now a limdil class object.
- Added \eqn{} markup to equations in pinvgauss.Rd
  remlscor.Rd and remlscorgamma.Rd.
- Elso et al (2004) reference added to compareGrowthCurves
  help page.

18 November 2008: statmod 1.3.8

- qres.nbinom now works in more situations.  It now accepts
  a model fit from MASS::glm.nb or a model fit using
  MASS:negative.binomial() when the theta argument is unnamed.
  Previously the theta argument had to be named, as in
  negative.binomial(theta=2).

20 July 2008: statmod 1.3.7

- reference added to help page for compareGrowthCurves()
- the saved output from the automatic tests updated for R 2.7.1

07 April 2008: statmod 1.3.6

- fixes to limdil() on estimate and upper bound of the confidence interval when all 
  cells respond to all tests.
- bug fix in limdil() which produced wrong calculation of the upper bound 
  and lower bound of the confidence interval when there are more than one group and
  no cells responds or all cells respond to all tests in one of the groups. 

24 March 2008: statmod 1.3.5

- The function remlscoregamma(), removed in 2004, restored to the package
  with updated references.

11 February 2008: statmod 1.3.4

- bug fix in limdil() which produced error when calculating the confidence
  intervals of multiple groups and all cells respond in one of the groups. 

12 January 2008: statmod 1.3.3

- the limdil function now has the capability to handle and compare
  multiple experiments or groups.

24 September 2007: statmod 1.3.1

12 December 2005: statmod 1.2.3

- remlscore() was failing when rank of X was only 1, now fixed.
